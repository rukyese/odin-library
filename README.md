# Library

A simple JavaScript-based Library built as part of The Odin Project curriculum. This project focuses on Object-Oriented Programming, DOM manipulation, and working with user input through forms and modals.

## Features

- Add books to your library using a form modal
- Display each book as a card with details like title, author, pages, and read status
- Remove books from your library
- Toggle read status of each book
- Each book has a unique `id` for proper tracking and manipulation
